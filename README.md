## AdaptRM 

1.	Description  

AdaptRM has a multi-tasking framework for the synergetic learning of epitranscriptomes. It was enabled by the adaptive pooling and several standard convolution blocks. Trained for an integrated multi-task formulated by three case studies, the model can operate on both low-resolution and high-resolution datasets without further preprocessing the input primary sequence, and conduct tissue-specific and type-specific prediction according to users’ needs. 

2.	Requirements  

Before prediction, please make sure the following packages are installed in the Python environment:  
python = 3.10.0  
torch = 1.12.0  
numpy = 1.22.3  
pandas = 1.4.4  
argparse = 1.4.0  
scikit-learn = 1.1.1  
autograd = 1.5.0  
listmodel = 0.2.1  

3.	Input and output  
* The input object should be a list of [1, -1, 4] representing a query sequence.  
* The output would be a vector of values. Each element ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the probability of its corresponding task.  
* The test.py is provided for converting .fasta file into the input sequence as requested, training a multi-task AdaptRM model and returning a .csv prediction file.
